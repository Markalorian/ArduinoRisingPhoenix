# ArduinoRisingPhoenix
Open-source version of the Rising Phoenix jetpack worn by Din Djarin in 'The Mandalorian'.

Includes LEDs with flame effect, sound effects, and smoke that is all controlled by a wireless remote.

## Parts list
You will need the following parts:
1) Arduino Nano - controller for this project.
2) Rising Phoenix board (or blank prototyping PCBs and connectors).
3) DFPlayer Mini - get an authentic one made by DFRobot. The knock-offs didn't work in my experience.
4) 1k ohm resistor - for the DFPlayer's RX pin. (This is included with the Rising Phoenix board.)
5) 12v mini amplifier - to increase the output of the DFPlayer Mini.
6) (2) 25mm exciters - these stick to the inside of the pack to create the sound in lieu of regular speakers.
7) (2) 16 bit Neopixel LED rings - to place inside the thrusters for the flame effect.
8) (4) 5v relay modules - to activate the various components.
9) (2) 5v 5015 blower fans - used to increase airflow of smoke.
10) (2) 12v mini air pumps - used to push air through the vaporizers.
11) (2) ecig vaporizers/atomizers - the Kanger T2 model works best and what this project was designed for but they are getting hard to find.
12) (2) 18650 batteries - need a high current output. These power the vaporizers.
13) Talentcell 3000 mAh rechargable battery pack - provides both 5v and 12v power to everything except the vaporizers.
14) Wiress RF remote - to activate the jetpack easily
